## Description
The IoT Smart Alarm Clock is a collaborative project created for an Internet of Things class. This innovative alarm clock boasts a range of smart features and was the result of a group effort, Logan Martlew working on the API, Caddidy Johnstone working on the project management, and myself on the hardware and embedded software.

The project uses a raspberry pi for the microcontroller and an express server as an API hosted on AWS.
