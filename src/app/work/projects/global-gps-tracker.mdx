## Description
Introducing the LTE/WiFi global GPS tracker (WIP), a fully capable inhouse built product designed for both IoT and asset tracking and recovery. This project is part of a business I, and some friends have started working on involving recovery of customer assets.

The device will connect to the internet and connect to an API hosted on my Raspberry Pi (for now, the code is containerised) where the backend will sort information from the arrays of devices, and file them into databases linked to customer information.

This is a large project, and still a work in progress.
