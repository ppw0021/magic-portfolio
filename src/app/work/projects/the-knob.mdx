## Description
This is a simple design for a Volume controller for any Android Head unit with a USB port. Using the touch buttons is infuriating and quite dangerous, so I decided to create my own volume knob.

The Arduino 'pretends' to be a keyboard, and plugs directly into my Android Head Unit on my car.

By twisting The Knobâ„¢, the Arduino Leonardo sends a volume up or volume down signal to the head unit and the volume is adjusted accordingly.
