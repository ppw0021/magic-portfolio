## Description
I created this highly ergonomic and efficient keyboard using 3 Arduinos. The Arduino Leonardo acts as a master to the Left and Right Keypads which each use a Arduino Pro Micro each.

The Leonardo communicates using the I2C Protocol to communicate with the slave devices using polling.

Each of the keypads also has more switches than inputs. I solved this problem by wiring the switches together as a matrix, connecting Pin 1 of each keyswitch for each row together, and Pin 2 of each keyswitch for each column together. This solution meant that by switching on each column and checking each input on the row, I am able to check the status of 30 switches using only 11 pins on the arduino.

I am also using Visual Studio Code to program the arduino using C++ and the PlatformIO Library.

The keyboard also has access to another set of inputs such as numbers and symbols by using an "alternative shift key" which dynamically switches the key from a letter to another character.
