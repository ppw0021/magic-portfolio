## Description
The Base 28 Encoding Program, a recent project that takes a Base 10 number as input and converts it to a Base 28 format using body parts. Inspired by anthropology research on the Papa New Guineans' use of body parts rather than numerical systems, this project offers a unique and engaging approach to encoding numbers. My partner suggested this project to me, and I am excited to showcase this concept.

The program uses complex recursion to convert a base 10 number into an equivalent base 28 number concept represented with body parts
