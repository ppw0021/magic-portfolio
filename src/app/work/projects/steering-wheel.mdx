## Description
This is an early prototype for a plug in steering wheel. MVP stands for 'Minimum Viable Product', it currently uses a 20 point rotary encoder, however I plan to incorporate my homemade rotary encoder into it to add more accuracy and precision.

The build is based off of an Arduino Leonardo.
