## Description

This project is a wireless DIY device that attaches to your hand, it uses a gyroscope module to detect its current rotation, three switches connected to the index, middle and ring finger, and a radio module to communicate with another device connected to the computer wirelessly.

This provides a seamless and simple way to interact with computers, here are some of the primary features:
- Moving your hand seamlessly and instantly moves the mouse on screen correspondingly.
- Pulling your index finger left clicks.
- Pulling your middle finger right clicks.
- Pulling your ring finger re-centres the mouse in the middle of the screen.
- Holding left and right click at the same time freezes the mouse and converts the motion of the device into scrolling motion.

I created this project as I was presenting a project on a projector at school and I had to keep looking down at the computer to change slides, bring up files and videos. By having a devices that straps to your wrist, presentations are made easier and navigation is more refined and streamlined.
