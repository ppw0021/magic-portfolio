## Description

This project is simply a Laser Tag game. Each gun uses Infra-red technology to communicate with each other. The features of this include:
- 8 Different weapons to choose from
- 2 Teams and a free for all
- 100+ meters of range
- Health mode selection
- Haptic, visual and audio feedback

Each gun has an IR led to send information and an array of IR receivers . Whenever a shot is fired, the IR led sends the current details of the gun (weapon used, team, etc) so that any other gun that is in a line of sight can take damage or ignore the signal (same team). This is achieved by using a bi-convex lens to focus light emitted from a IR led into a parallel beam (like a bullet).

The frame is entirely 3D printed from PLA plastic and the total project cost was roughly $50.

## Technology used
- C++
